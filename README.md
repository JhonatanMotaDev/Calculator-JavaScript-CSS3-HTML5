This project is about a simple calculator, maked using HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript !

<h2>1st phase: (04/12/2022 - 05/12/2022)</h2><br>
<h3>research, study & pratice...</h3><br>
Is a lot cool study front-end, is a new universe of possibilities, is really fun make designs using CSS, the texts with HTML5, and the logic part using JavaScript.<br>
"What is the purpose of the calculator? The calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Some also do square roots. and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs. Calculators are found everywhere!". Is a powerful tool, that we use in a whole lotta applications in our daily life, can be used in basic math, or in advanced math types!<br>
The math is the most important part in computation! every calculation that your computer can do, is only possible through the math use!<br>
after the initial explanation, i'm put the phases of the project below, and as the days go by, i'm gonna refresh the project phases.

2nd Phase - (06/12/2022 - 07/12/2022<br>
production process , consolidation of acquired knowledge & finish of the project...<br>
finally finished my first HTML project, I'm very happy to be starting this journey on a long road in the programmation world! I hope this is the first of many projects! that all involve fun, learning, and above all a positive impact on other people's lives, either directly or indirectly, this project was divided into two parts, the first: (learning process, and consolidation of acquired knowledge), and the second phase: (implementation, testing, and finally UI customization),
this first step towards a great journey in this new universe of programming is exciting, and at the same time uncertain, but I'm sure it will be wonderful! I thank everyone who is here, and those who are about to arrive.
